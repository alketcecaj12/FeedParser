<title>A farewell to Britain</title>
<description>LO, BREXIT is under way. And I have effected my own exit: having penned my last Bagehot column I now turn to Germany and its neighbourhood as The Economist’s new bureau chief in Berlin. That outgoing column conveys some thoughts about Britain’s troubled present.</description>

<title>Labour and UKIP both give Tories cause for delight</title>
<description>IT IS a measure of Labour’s sorry state these days that losing just one of two seats that it has held for decades is treated as grounds for relief in the party.</description>

<title>The pragmatic case for moving Britain’s capital to Manchester</title>
<description>ON TUESDAY the clerk of the House of Commons warned that the proposed repairs to the Houses of Parliament would cost even more than estimated. David Natzler’s intervention was just the latest indication of the battles to come.</description>

<title>What Brexit and Donald Trump have in common</title>
<description>COMPARISONS between Donald Trump’s presidential win and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union have often been overdone. Though during the campaign Mr Trump called himself “Mr Brexit” and promised “Brexit plus, plus, plus” for America, many Britons voted for Leave who would not dream of supporting him.</description>

<title>A court ruling on Article 50 hints at Britain’s coming constitutional storm</title>
<description>ON THE morning of January 24th the Supreme Court ruled that Britain’s government has to put Article 50 (the formal two-year process by which Britain will leave the European Union) to a vote in parliament. It should never have come to this. Last summer Brexiteers won the EU referendum by pledging to return sovereignty to Westminster.</description>

<title>Britain should seek Donald Trump’s respect, not his affection</title>
<description>THE urgency with which Britain’s Brexiteer elite has scrambled to cosy up to Donald Trump in the weeks building up to today’s inauguration has been something to behold. Leading the way was Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader, flashing a mile-wide grin as he posed for souvenir snaps with the president-elect.</description>

<title>Theresa May confirms: Britain is heading for Brexit Max</title>
<description>FOR the past few months Theresa May and her ministers have allowed some ambiguities to swirl around Britain’s future relationship with the European Union. Yes, she confirmed in her conference speech in October, Brexit would take it beyond the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the EU’s free movement regime.</description>

<title>On the dangers of comparing every political event to Donald Trump</title>
<description>A PATTERN is emerging in political journalism. Whenever something can be construed as a rejection of the establishment, or a win for authoritarianism, or a triumph for swaggering, braces-twanging bombast—or some other shift the writer does not like—the subject is ascribed to a global Trump-ite revolution.</description>

<title>Labour, not the Tories, should be most worried by the Richmond Park result</title>
<description>IN A year of grim defeats for internationalists in Britain and abroad, a morsel of relief. The Liberal Democrats pitched yesterday’s by-election in Richmond Park as a chance for voters to voice scepticism about Brexit. The gambit worked: Sarah Olney took the south-west London seat with an increased vote-share of 30.4 points.</description>

<title>Anglo-German relations are defined by mutual incomprehension</title>
<description>“MARK my words. Within a year she’ll be gone. She’s stuffed.” Thus a senior Cameroon surveyed the landscape almost exactly a year—and what feels like many political ages—ago over dinner. He was talking of Angela Merkel, whose handling of the refugee crisis 10 Downing Street considered suicidal.</description>

<title>Nicola Sturgeon’s consultation on a new Scottish independence referendum gets her out of a tight spot</title>
<description>DELEGATES and journalists arriving in Glasgow today for the Scottish National Party (SNP) conference had one big subject on their minds: the political puzzle that has been hanging over Nicola Sturgeon since June 23rd. In Britain’s referendum on leaving the EU, every single area of Scotland voted to remain in the union.</description>

<title>Parliament must push for a bigger role in the Brexit negotiations</title>

<title>Jeremy Corbyn is re-elected with an increased mandate</title>
<description>OWEN SMITH was never the front-runner in Labour’s leadership contest. But moderates in the party hoped that he would at least begin the process of clipping away at the mighty mandate, 59% of vote, that accrued to Jeremy Corbyn last year. Perhaps this could be shaved to nearer 50%.</description>

<title>What is the point of the Liberal Democrats?</title>
<description>THE title of this post is the question that—more than ever before—I find myself asking following the Liberal Democrats’ just-finished gathering in Brighton. It was my fourth Lib Dem conference. My first, also in Brighton, was in 2012. Back then, too, the talk was of the party’s identity crisis.</description>

<title>Why a “True Labour” splinter party could succeed where the SDP failed</title>
<description>LABOUR is in the midst of a roller-coaster leadership election. Today a court ruled that the 130,000 people who have joined the party since January (most of them supporters of Jeremy Corbyn) will not be able to vote. That is a blow to the party’s far-left leader, but he will probably still win.</description>

<title>Britain’s newly interventionist economic consensus is a question, not an answer</title>

<title>Britain’s new prime minister will regret appointing Boris Johnson</title>
<description>IT WAS sweeping, ruthless and decisive. “Brutal reshuffle, prime minister?” shouted reporters as Theresa May arrived back in Downing Street after a morning going through Cameroons like a hot knife through butter. A smile dashed across the new prime minister’s face as she strode into her new house. What to make of it?</description>

<title>Donald Trump, trade and the new world order</title>
<description>TWO months into the Trump administration and we have had more sound and fury than concrete proposals about its economic agenda. The most alarming sign so far is that America forced the G20 to drop a pledge about resisting “all forms of protectionism” from a joint statement but this may be purely symbolic.</description>

<title>Euphoria returns to markets</title>
<description>LIKE the weather in Chicago, you don’t have to wait long for a new trend in the stockmarkets.

Now they have been recording new highs again.</description>

<title>Are big infrastructure projects castles in the air or bridges to nowhere?</title>
<description>IF THERE is a consensus right now in American politics, it must be that infrastructure spending is a good thing. It employs workers, improves economic efficiency and, at the moment, can be financed at rock-bottom bond yields. So why don’t governments get on with it? The problem is multi-faceted.</description>

<title>Enfant de la Patrie</title>
<description>HE IS French, 22 years old, and comes from a quiet rural village in Normandy. He is also, the French government suspects, one of the executioners in a video released by Islamic State (IS) on November 16th which shows the beheading of 14 Syrian soldiers and Peter Kassig, an American aid worker. France has been well aware for some time of the problem of home-grown jihadist recruits. But the revelation that one of them seems to have taken part in beheadings is of an altogether different order of concern. Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, tentatively identified the young man (pictured, at right) as Maxime Hauchard, from the Norman hamlet of Bosc-Roger-en-Roumois. Stunned neighbours described a quiet boy not known to be a troublemaker. Mr Hauchard converted to Islam at the age of 17, according to French news reports, having become radicalised through the internet and social media. After two trips to Mauritania, Mr Hauchard arrived in Syria via Turkey in 2013,... Continue reading</description>

<title>All that glitters</title>
<description>AMONG the growing number of hard-up European governments offering residence permits to wealthy non-Europeans who invest in their countries, Portugal has been the most successful. In return for real-estate purchases and other investments totalling more than €1 billion ($1.25 billion), Portuguese authorities have issued 1,775 so-called “golden visas” over the past two years , 81% of them to Chinese nationals. But success turned to scandal on November 13th, when police made 60 raids across the country, detaining 11 people in a crackdown on suspected corruption by officials administering the scheme. Among those held were the head of Portugal’s border agency and the president of the country's registration and notary institute. Three days later, Miguel Macedo (pictured), the interior minister in the centre-right government, resigned. The investigation in Portugal, codenamed “Operation Labyrinth”, could have wider ramifications across Europe, where... Continue reading</description>

<title>Yes and no</title>
<description>AFTER months of “will-they, won't-they” brinkmanship, Catalans were finally able to vote Sunday on whether they wanted to become an independent nation . In Lleida, the tranquil capital of a mostly rural province known for its fruit farms and pigs, all was calm at the city's eight voting stations. A single police officer stood outside the Josep Lladanosa secondary school, as citizens braved the winter chill to deposit their votes. The polling had no legal force; Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, contends a vote not sanctioned by Madrid would be unconstitutional, and the country's constitutional court is still deciding the question. Instead it was, depending on your point of view, either a piece of mass civil disobedience led by Catalan president Artur Mas, or an entirely legal mock referendum that puts pressure on Madrid to stage a real one. Voters (including the pro-independence marchers above) were delighted. Mobile phone selfies were the order of the day as, at least in... Continue reading</description>

<title>How real is Osborne&#039;s &quot;real result&quot;?</title>
<description>WITH a spring in his step, George Osborne (pictured), the British finance minister, left today's meeting of European Union finance ministers announcing that he had secured a "real result" for Britain in the row over its increased EU budget contributions. Two weeks ago Britain was saddled with a surcharge of €2.1 billion ($2.6 billion), thanks to a recalculation of its national income dating back over a decade. (Other countries were presented with smaller amounts.) The monies were due on December 1st. But that bill, said Mr Osborne today, would be halved, the payment schedule delayed, and the rules permanently changed to ensure nothing like this could ever happen again.  In the run-up to today's meeting EU officials and Britain's European partners had insisted that the €2.1 billion calculation was made according to rules to which all members, including Britain, had signed up. But David Cameron, the British prime minister, insisted that Britain would pay neither on time nor "anything like" that amount, adding... Continue reading</description>

<title>Poison pen</title>
<description>TRAVELLING around Ireland a few months after it became the second euro-zone country to seek a bail-out, your correspondent was surprised to discover a shared belief among almost everyone he met: that by agreeing to the €67 billion ($87 billion) rescue, the Irish had essentially bailed out Europe rather than the other way around. Few denied that the Irish had brought their troubles upon themselves, by living high on the hog and selling vastly overpriced houses to one another. But there was a strong feeling that the European Central Bank, in particular, had bullied a small government into accepting terms for the creditors for its large banks that it would not have chosen had it acted alone. To many, that suspicion was confirmed Thursday when the ECB published a letter (leaked earlier in the day to the Irish... Continue reading</description>

<title>Of riots to come</title>
<description>A GROUP calling itself "Hooligans Against Salafists" had dutifully registered to stage a legal demonstration against jihadist Islam in central Cologne on October 26th. But on Facebook and Twitter the call quickly spread. Ultimately some 4,800 people showed up, most of them male and looking for trouble, gathering between Cologne's train station and its famous cathedral. A right-wing band called Kategorie C started playing. (Category C is German police jargon for football fans looking for a fight, as opposed to Category A, who actually want to watch football, and Category B, who while not hell-bent on fisticuffs are open to a scuffle if one presents itself.) Neo-Nazis pranced about, giving the Hitler salute. They included "SS-Siggi", a blond giant who is a celebrity in fascist circles. Beer bottles started flying. Soon, a full-fledged street battle pitted violent hooligans against 1,300 cops, about 50 of whom ended up injured. The images , reminiscent of street fighting during the Weimar republic of the 1920s, shocked Germans. Some called for banning... Continue reading</description>

<title>Pot calling kettle</title>
<description>BEFORE the European Parliament approved a new team for the European Commission last week (pictured), it made sure to leave its mark. Heeding the warnings of Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission's president, that this was "last chance saloon" to restore trust in the EU, MEPs eyed potential scalps among the nominees, making these the most political soundings to date. The buzzword of the interrogations was “transparency”. That was all to the good. But the EP itself has a long way to go before it lives up to the standards of transparency it sought to impose on Mr Juncker's new commissioners. For all the noisy grilling, the two big centre-right and social democrat groupings avoided taking down each other’s favourites in the hearings. Miguel Arias Cañete, energy and climate change commissioner, was harangued by left-wing MEPs over his family’s interests in two oil storage companies.... Continue reading</description>

<title>No more Mr Nice Guy</title>
<description>WHEN Matteo Renzi (pictured)  won 41% of the Italian vote in the European Parliament election in May, there was an almost audible sigh of relief among pro-Europeans. Here at least, it seemed, was a country where voters remained loyal to the EU project. And what is more, it had a dynamic young leader who could trounce adversaries with a campaign appealing to traditional, pro-European ideals. That was always a grossly simplistic analysis. And on October 23rd the outgoing Commission president, José Manuel Barroso, found out just how wrong it was. In an act of studied contempt, Mr Renzi’s government published online the Commission’s “strictly confidential” letter demanding an explanation for Italy’s draft 2015 budget. Unveiled on October 15th, the Continue reading</description>

<title>Awkward timing</title>
<description>IT BEGAN with a bleeding nose and ended with a punch in the face. Yesterday's meeting of European Union heads of government in Brussels started inauspiciously, when the Cypriot president was taken to hospital after a series of nosebleeds; caused, said doctors, by high blood pressure. (The Greek prime minister stepped in to represent Cypriot interests.) The day ended on a yet sourer note, when it emerged that Britain would have to stump up an extra €2.1 billion ($2.7 billion) for the EU budget by December, after the European Commission revised its calculations for gross national income, on which budget contributions are partly based, over the past 20 years. Italy, the Netherlands and Greece, among others, must also pay more; deliciously, the French and the Germans will enjoy rebates of varying amounts. Commission officials were quick to point out that they were just applying rules agreed to by all EU members, including Britain, back in 2010. But the timing of the news was dreadful. Not...

<title>What lies beneath</title>
<description>IT WAS as though the cold war had never ended. A hazy shape spotted by island residents in the southern Stockholm archipelago on October 17th quickly prompted suspicions of an incursion by a Russian submarine. The Swedish armed forces leapt into action, establishing a no-fly zone. The navy deployed fast-attack vessels (pictured), cordoning off a wide swath of water and forcing Swedish pleasure boaters seeking the last good autumn weather to leave. But after days of searching, the military is still not sure what, if anything, is out there. Although officially neutral and not a NATO member, Sweden is no stranger to Russian provocations. Besides the possible submarine, Russian planes have violated Swedish and Finnish airspace in recent months. Against the backdrop of Russian military intervention in Ukraine, Sweden, like other countries, is growing increasingly nervous about what Moscow... Continue reading</description>

<title>Europe&#039;s first Ebola victim</title>
<description>FEAR spreads faster than disease. But when the first contagion of Ebola outside west Africa, where the disease has killed 3,400 people since March, struck in Madrid on October 6th locals worried not just about its proliferation but also about the competence of their health authorities. The first victim is a 44-year-old hospital worker, Teresa Romero, who volunteered to help when two Spanish missionaries were flown home from Africa to die of the disease. Health workers in Africa are among the disease’s most frequent victims. In the developed world hospitals have elaborate protocols to cope with the danger of contagion. Ms Romero should have worn the right protective clothing, known the safety protocols properly and been quickly spotted as a danger to public health once ill. Yet after Ms Romero caught the virus, she spent ten days on holiday in Madrid, sat a public exam and visited a health centre and hospital to seek help with her first symptoms. Ms Romero wore protective clothing at work and claimed she followed the protocols. She also rang the hospital where she worked to ask for advice on dealing with her early symptoms, but her temperature was not... Continue reading</description>

<title>Tough hearings ahead</title>
<description>THE European Parliament will begin grilling the 28 candidates for the new European Commission today—and MEPs are determined to leave their mark on the new team. With the power to veto the entire commission team, the parliament has in the past successfully rejected candidates. Some parliamentarians are looking to add to that tally. MEPs are in a confident mood after outmaneuvering the European Council earlier this summer to secure the appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured) as president of the commission. David Cameron, the British prime minister. had made it his personal mission to overturn the so-called Spitzenkandidaten process, in part because of his damming take on a roll-call of Brussels insiders, but also to resist an overt power grab by the parliament. Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, shared some of Mr Cameron’s misgivings, but ultimately the council gave in. Only the controversial Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, joined Mr Cameron in voting against Mr Juncker’s appointment. Emboldened by that success, the parliament has set its sights on Mr Juncker's appointments. Britain’s Jonathan Hill is the primary target for... Continue reading</description>

<title>Getting to “sí”</title>
<description>THEY put a brave face on it in Catalonia. The Scottish "no" vote , said Catalan president Artur Mas, was a triumph for democracy and an enviable example of how to resolve nationalist tension within a European state. But it was also a setback. A Scottish "yes" would have proved that a European Union state can break up, and obliged EU leaders to find a way to cope. Catalan separatists would have tried to fall into Scotland's slipstream, using its vote to boost support for a movement that has grown rapidly; some polls show a majority of Catalans favour a split. But while the Scottish referendum was jointly proposed by the British and Scottish governments, Mr Mas is treading a more dangerous path. Madrid has refused to hold a referendum , so he is going it alone. On Friday Catalonia's parliament passed a so-called “law of consultations”, with a view to allowing...

<title>The peace and safety of our throne</title>
<description>THE  troonrede , the annual speech delivered by the Dutch monarch to parliament, is in part an occasion for sounding the national mood, and in part an occasion for prominent women to wear  exceptionally silly hats . It takes place on a day the Dutch call  prinsjesdag , or Prince's Day, which also celebrates (or mourns, as the case may be) the presentation of the government's budget for the coming year. There are equestrian performances by mounted guards, King Willem-Alexander (pictured, with Queen Maxima) arrives at the  ridderzaal  (Knights' Hall) borne in the royal Golden Coach, and so forth. But this year the charming rituals of September 16th were enveloped by what the king called a "black border of mourning": the memory of the destruction of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine in July, and the deaths of 196 Dutch passengers on board. That event, and the broader conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East that have dominated the news this summer, have caused a significant change in the Dutch public's attitude towards...

<title>Valls optimism</title>
<description>MANUEL VALLS (pictured), the reformist French prime minister, faces a trying parliamentary vote of confidence in his Socialist government today, as he tries to face down backbench rebels unhappy with the direction of economic policy. This will be his first vote of confidence since a government reshuffle in August, and Mr Valls has raised the stakes, declaring that times are sombre, that his party should behave responsibly and that the far-right National Front is “at the gates of power”. The government needs an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly in order to survive the vote. Failure to secure this would lead to fresh legislative elections and prompt a political crisis in France. Mr Valls survived a previous vote of confidence back in April, shortly after his nomination by President François Hollande, by a margin of 33 votes. At a later vote on the social-security budget in July, however, the gap shrank to just 18. Since then, a group of Socialist rebels has become increasingly... Continue reading</description>

<title>The transformation of German politics</title>
<description>THE place to be on election nights these days in Germany is not inside the respective state parliament but at whatever restaurant the Alternative for Germany has rented that evening. So it was two weeks ago in Dresden , when Saxons voted and swept the Alternative, an anti-euro and generally conservative party founded only last year, into its first state parliament. So it was again yesterday in Potsdam and Erfurt, when Brandenburgers and Thuringians voted and gave the Alternative two even greater triumphs: 10.6% in Thuringia and 12.2% in Brandenburg. I chose to hear the evening's first estimate at 6PM with supporters and leaders of the Alternative in an elegant restaurant inside a neo-Baroque courtyard near Brandenburg's newly restored state parliament. When the bar charts came up on the screen, the room erupted in a roar and then shook for minutes of clapping and howling.  All the patterns the... Continue reading</description>

For weeks the centre-right alliance under Fredrik Reinfeldt had been chipping away at the big lead of the centre-left block, led by the Social Democrats' Stefan Löfven. But after the election on September 14th Mr Reinfeldt conceded defeat and resigned as prime minister. He also said he would step down as leader of the Moderate Party. Yet it will not prove easy for Mr Löfven to take his place. The Social Democrats, the Greens and the Left Party took 43.6% of the vote to the alliance's 39.5%. Mr Löfven can happily work with the Greens, but not so well with the ex-communist left. He is talking of trying to prise away smaller parties in the alliance, but will find that extremely hard. The far-right Sweden Democrats, with whom nobody will work, caused... Continue reading</description>

<title>Valérie thanks François</title>
<description>“I RUN into the bathroom. I grab the little plastic bag containing sleeping pills…François follows me. He tries to seize the bag. I run into the bedroom. He grabs the bag, which rips open. Pills spill all over the bed and the floor. I manage to recover some. I swallow what I can.” It reads like one of those French art-house movies about theatrical marital breakdown, shot in close-up and set in an elegant apartment. Except that this is not fiction, but real life, as recounted by Valérie Trierweiler, the former partner of François Hollande, the Socialist president, whose tell-all book on their split—“Merci pour ce moment”—is published on September 4th. It is unusual to find a serving head of state’s private life chronicled in excruciating detail by his ex-partner. For the French, who have traditionally considered the public interest to stop at the bedroom door, it is an earthquake. Mr Hollande is said to have known nothing about the book. Ms Trierweiler, a journalist, wrote and published it in secret. Extracts published early in Paris-Match , a weekly where Ms Trierweiler works, do not flatter Mr Hollande. She describes him in office as... Continue reading</description>

<title>Another little piece of Europe shifts right</title>
<description>AS ONE, the supporters of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), founded only last year, cheered into the echoing vault they had rented for their election-night party next to the river Elbe in Dresden. The evening's first projection on August 31st had just put the AfD near 10% of the vote in Saxony, clearly above the 5% threshold to enter that state's parliament. Moments later, Frauke Petry (pictured), the party's boss in Saxony, entered and was mobbed as though she were a rockstar. Great work, she beamed back at her fans, but the real effort only starts now: In two weeks, the Alternative also wants to enter the state parliaments of Brandenburg and Thuringia. The AfD began as a single-issue party, calling for an orderly unravelling of the euro. In the past year, it has added piecemeal other positions, from an increase in direct democracy to a return to conservative economics. At times--as in Saxony, where it is strongest--it has also mixed xenophobic innuendo into its messages. Although it pulls voters from all the other parties, it is most successful on the right.  The Alternative's newest success, coming hard on the heels of its entry into the European...

<title>Back to work</title>
<description>UNUSUALLY for a European Union summit, this one was supposed to wrap up early. "We're hoping to be done by nine o'clock," said one British official cheerfully, as proceedings kicked off yesterday evening in Brussels. But it was closer to 1.00am by the time the club's 28 leaders clambered wearily into their limousines. There turned out to be rather a lot to discuss. The European Council summit, the first ever to be held in August, was arranged last month after the EU's leaders failed to agree on the appointment of two senior positions: the president of the Council, who oversees meetings and tries to find common ground among leaders, and the high representative for foreign affairs. In the days and weeks leading up to last night Herman van Rompuy, who holds the former position, worked the phones hard to arrive at something close to a consensus. It worked: the jobs discussion was concluded crisply (see below).  It proved a little trickier to find agreement around two weightier matters: how to kickstart the sluggish European economy, and how to respond to Russian revanchism...

<title>No more Cuban-style policies?</title>
<description>IN MANY respects, the new French government, which was unveiled today, looks a lot like the old one. The reformist Manuel Valls is still prime minister. Laurent Fabius stays on as foreign minister; Michel Sapin continues as finance minister; Jean-Yves Le Drian keeps his job at defence; Ségolène Royal remains in charge of the environment and energy; Bernard Cazeneuve stays at the interior ministry. But there was one big surprise, as symbolic as it was encouraging: the appointment of Emmanuel Macron (pictured) to replace Arnaud Montebourg as industry and economy minister. Aged only 36, Mr Macron was until June this year economic adviser at the Elysée, the presidential palace, where he saw it as his mission to steer the Socialist government under President François Hollande away from its paleo-thinking towards a more modern form of social democracy. Mr Macron resigned after Mr Hollande installed the moderate Mr Valls as prime minister, arguing that this job was done. If Mr Valls wanted to send a message with his new government, Mr Macron is it. Mr Montebourg, who was ousted the previous day, had a knack of irking foreign investors, once telling Mittal, a... Continue reading</description>

<title>The government goes</title>
<description>THE entire French government resigned unexpectedly today after bitter internal disagreements over economic policy. In a statement, President François Hollande announced that his prime minister, Manuel Valls (pictured left), who has been in the job for only five months, would name a new team tomorrow. Much depends on the new line-up, but the best outcome could—just possibly—be an end to the contradictions and muddle that have marked economic policy ever since Mr Hollande, a Socialist, was elected president in 2012. The immediate trigger for this reshuffle was a weekend interview in Le Monde , a daily, followed by a political rally on August 24th, in which Arnaud Montebourg, the economy minister and long-time anti-austerity advocate, lashed out at Mr Valls’s economic policy. Enforced deficit reduction, he said, was an “economic aberration” and “financial absurdity”. France should not align itself with the “ideological axioms of the German right”, he added, and an alternative economic policy was... Continue reading</description>

<title>A painful decision</title>
<description>FOR other weapons exporters, the decision was easy. The Islamic State (IS) has overrun and terrorised swathes of Iraq and Syria. Germany is, with Britain and France, one of Europe’s biggest arms-makers. Fears of the possible genocide of Iraq’s Yazidis and brutality like the beheading of an American journalist, James Foley, have made dealing with IS especially urgent. Yet the German government tiptoed carefully into its announcement that it had decided to arm Kurdish forces to break IS’s momentum. Germany vocally opposed the 2003 war in Iraq, and the chaos of the past decade there has bolstered voters’ conviction that this was the right decision. Germany’s traditional post-war pacifism has made any involvement, even in less-controversial wars like Kosovo or Afghanistan, ticklish. The government is keeping its plans vague for now. This has been taken to mean that the deliveries will, at first, include bulletproof vests, night-goggles and transport. Whether and when deadly weapons will also be supplied is another question. The region has shown a repeated ability to surprise. IS fighters are well armed with weapons originally provided by Americans to... Continue reading</description>

<title>Righteous in Holland and Gaza</title>
<description>HENK ZANOLI (pictured) is a 91-year-old retired Dutch lawyer whose personal history encapsulates the reasons why the Netherlands and Israel have had such friendly relations since the foundation of the Jewish state in the wake of the second world war. Mr Zanoli's family was, as the Dutch put it, "right in the war"—i.e. members of the resistance. In 1943 Mr Zanoli escorted an 11-year-old Jewish boy from Amsterdam, Elchanan Pinto, back to the family home in the village of Eemnes, where he and his mother Johanna hid him for the rest of the war. (His father, Henk Senior, had already been sent to a concentration camp for his resistance activities; he would die at Mauthausen.) Mr Pinto subsequently emigrated to Israel. Three years ago, the Israeli Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem awarded its "Righteous Among the Nations" medal , given to non-Jews who rescued Jews from the Nazis, to Mr Zanoli and (posthumously) his mother. On August 11th  Haaretz 's  Amira Hass reports , Mr Zanoli sent Yad Vashem its medal back.... Continue reading</description>

<title>Erdogan wins</title>
<description>TURKEY’S prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan (pictured with his wife), became the country’s first popularly elected president yesterday, marking his ninth consecutive electoral victory during 12 years in power. He received 52% of the vote, averting the need for a runoff. The strong result will have a profound impact on the future of Turkey’s shaky democracy. In a victory speech at the headquarters of his Justice and Development (AK) party in Ankara, Mr Erdogan declared that this was the “start of a new era”, signalling his intentions to continue to rule the country from the presidential palace and to give Turkey a new constitution that would, among other things, give him executive powers. As president Mr Erdogan pledged to embrace all citizens regardless of their ethnicity or creed.  “The national will” would now find its voice in the presidential palace, he roared. Mr Erdogan’s critics recall that he made similar promises in the past. Throughout his campaign Mr Erdogan struck an unabashedly polarising tone, taking aim at the Alevi faith of the main opposition leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, and the ethnic Zaza roots of his Kurdish rival,...

<title>Johnson becomes a column once again</title>
<description>IT HAS been just a bit over three years since our 1990s-era Johnson column in the newspaper was revived as this blog . Johnson's format is now about to change again—to become, once more, a column. This time it will be hosted online, on our sister blog  Prospero , which covers cultural matters. If you haven't already added Prospero to your RSS reader, you should do so anyway. But now it will feature, each week, a longer and more developed set of thoughts on a language-related topic. We hope that readers who miss the frequency and the sometimes off-the-cuff nature of the blog will accept the trade-off of reduced frequency but greater depth. After two weeks' holiday, the Johnson column will begin appearing on Prospero in the week beginning July 22nd. See you there.</description>

<description>WHEN using any kind of translation helper—dictionary, Babel Fish or Google Translate—remember that if you don't know the target language, you should always have a native speaker take a look at the final product. Otherwise, your results might be as flamboyantly incompetent as those in this shop window, which I passed not long ago in midtown Manhattan.  To attract foreign tourists, the store's owners have tried to translate "Welcome" into a variety of languages. But in almost every case, they chose something inapt. Here they are, starting at the top left: Welcome (English):  OK, this is right. Empfang (German):  Nope. This is "welcome" in the sense of a reception, like "they received a fine welcome," or the reception area in a hotel. It can't be used to greet people. That would be  Willkommen . accueil (French):  Nope. This means "reception" or "greeting". They want  bienvenue . boas-vindas (Portuguese):  Nope. Boas-vindas  is a noun used the phrase dar as boas-vindas , "to give a... Continue reading</description>

<title>One state, many worlds, now what?</title>
<description>  THE music video “Ek Sur”, more popularly known as “ Mile Sur Mera Tumhara ”, was released on India’s Independence Day in 1988. It was a small contribution to the country’s herculean post-independence task of building a unified national identity. The song’s lyrics were written in all 14 languages recognised by the constitution at the time. (The number has since increased to 22.) Playing off India’s many cultures, the performers sing: “When your song and my song meet, they become our song.” In typical Indian fashion, the video is both kitschy and irresistible. It has since attained legendary status, eclipsing even a hi-fi, star-studded 2010 remake. “Ek Sur” represents one piece of the ongoing effort to define who and what is “Indian”, one of modern India’s most pressing challenges. On a smaller scale, the southwestern state of Karnataka struggles with some of the same issues. Karnataka was created in 1956 from adjoining, mostly Kannada-speaking districts in four different states. The three other southern Indian states were created using language-based distinctions around the same time. The reorganisations were meant to strengthen... Continue reading</description>

<title>A language with too many armies and navies?</title>
<description>JOHNSON has touched on Arabic and its variety quite a few times over the years, but we have never really addressed a critical question directly: what is "Arabic" today, and is it really even a single thing? A short and simplified version of the story follows: the prophet Muhammad wrote (or received from Allah directly) the Koran in the seventh century. He then conquered nearly all of Arabia as a political and military leader. His successors—four "rightly guided" caliphs and then the Umayyad caliphs—spread Islam further still, until the Islamic world stretched from Spain to Pakistan. Arabic-speaking soldiers and administrators settled in all of these places, and their language gradually took root among local populations, who up until that point spoke languages from rustic Latin to Berber to Coptic to Persian.  That was almost 1400 years ago. The Arabic of the Koran remained a prestigious and nearly unchanging standard throughout the Islamic world. This is what most Arabs consider "Arabic". But all spoken languages change, all the time, and the Arabic people actually used on the streets and in their homes, predictably enough, changed... Continue reading</description>

<title>Review: Babbel and Duolingo</title>
<description>JUST twenty years ago, a language student removed from live practice or in-person classes had to rely on books or cassette tapes. Those were tough times: learners needed exceptional motivation, and got little feedback on their progress. Later on, websites providing textbook-style grammar lessons would pop up, making access easier but still giving little in the way of interaction. Starting in the mid-1990s, Rosetta Stone (whose latest incarnation Johnson reviewed  in January) added a bit of interactivity to the learning process, if at steep prices. As software like Rosetta Stone’s improved and added more online functions, free and low-cost services started to appear to compete with it. Unlike older rote grammar websites, the best among these sites have focused on interaction and personalised feedback. Livemocha , for one, pairs far-flung learners on its forums and encourages users to trade languages. Livemocha and its 16m subscribers were swallowed up by Rosetta Stone in April, filling out Rosetta Stone’s once-vacant online forums. For those who lack the patience for forums or the pockets for pricey services, there are (of course) apps for that. Two in particular stand out as excellent. The first is Duolingo , which I have been... Continue reading</description>

<title>Crazy long words</title>
<description>THE  Wall Street Journal  last week had a sweet article about non-Nordic Europeans learning languages like Norwegian and Finnish, the better to be able to sing along with their favorite Nordic metal bands: "It's quite a well-known phenomenon that students in Italy study Norwegian because they're interested in metal," Ms. [Siri] Nergaard [,a teacher,] said. Irene Burdese, currently teaching Norwegian to 92 people in Turin, and Milan-based Kristian Bjornsen, who is also teaching the language to Italians, both say Norway's unique brand of "black metal"—a darker blend of thick beats and sometimes-Satanic themes—is a big inspiration. The piece says that these fans must be very devoted indeed. The reason?  They must learn languages with  very long words .   Norwegian has some long words too, such as fylkestrafikksikkerhetsutvalgssekretariatslederfunksjonene , a not-commonly used word meaning a county's traffic security committee's leader's functions. Engstelige toner is Norwegian for "anxious notes," referring to music, and ansiktsmaling means face paint. Some words are the same as in English;... Continue reading</description>

<title>Growing pains</title>
<description>LANGUAGE learners must resign themselves to making very public, very silly mistakes sooner or later. It’s an occupational hazard. Regular readers will remember that I’ve begun dipping my feet in Dutch . After a few weeks, I can now get my most basic wants and needs across with little trouble. I’m only just starting, but I’m not exactly helpless anymore. Imagine my frustration, then, when nobody understood me when I tried to speak about the lake in Amsterdam (IJ), the large artificial lake north of Amsterdam (IJsselmeer), or a local road in The Hague (IJsclubsweg). I even got blank stares when I mentioned the neighbourhood ice cream shop (IJssalon). Now, my pronunciation is far from perfect, but it's usually workable. Unfortunately, I had been pronouncing the first two letters in each, IJ , as initials: I-J, or (roughly) “ee-yay” in Dutch. Apparently that’s as incomprehensible as referring to this newspaper as The E-C-onomist . IJ is, it turns out, a digraph in Dutch. That means it’s used together to represent one sound, pronounced (roughly) “ay”. It’s a fixed digraph, so when it appears at the beginning of a word, both I and J are capitalised together. In contrast, we might write of the Ij , the Ijsselmeer or... Continue reading</description>

<title>Why so little Chinese in English?</title>
<description>How to kowtow ON TWITTER, a friend asked "Twenty years from now, how many Chinese words will be common parlance in English?" I replied that we've already had 35 years since Deng Xiaoping began opening China's economy, resulting in its stratospheric rise—but almost no recent Chinese borrowings in English. Many purported experts are willing to explain China to curious (and anxious) westerners. And yet I can't think of even one Chinese word or phrase that has become "common parlance in English" recently. The only word that comes close might be  guanxi , the personal connections and relationships critical to getting things done in China. Plenty of articles can be found discussing the importance of  guanxi ,  but the word isn't "common in English" by any stretch. Most Chinese words now part of English show, in...

<title>More perplexing Portuguese</title>
<description>THANKS to all those who commented on my post about foreigners' most common misunderstandings in Brazil, which generated some media interest here. A few pointed out that several of my observations would hold equally well elsewhere in Latin America, or indeed further afield, in particular the relaxed approach to appointments and deadlines and the physical warmth. Others mentioned within-country variations, which certainly exist. The further north you go the more spectacularly late events run. Paulistanos (residents of São Paulo) greet each other with a single air-kiss; residents of Amazonia run more to bear-hugs. My original examples and readers' suggestions, some of which I've collated below, turned out to fall naturally into three groups. The first lot stem from Brazilians' flexible attitudes to time and location; the second from their loathing of conflict and in particular having to say "no". Foreigners in Brazil would be well advised to give much more weight to any signs of ambivalence, whether in body language or a vagueness about details, than to seemingly positive words. The third group includes overstretched analogies, unmeant invitations and extravagant compliments, which have their origin in the high value... Continue reading</description>

<title>Schibboleth</title>
<description>STORIES say that during the second world war, Dutch soldiers used the name of the seaside resort Scheveningen as a shibboleth to identify German soldiers in their midst. German soldiers would pronounce the first three letters "sch" as "sh", following German sound rules. (English speakers might do the same, partly on account of our familiarity with German proper names and words like "schnapps" and "schnitzel".) Most Dutch speakers, on the other hand, read "sch" as [s?], a run-of-the-mill "s" followed by a sound that’s akin to the Scottish "ch" in loch .* Today, Dutch civilians use Scheveningen as a shibboleth to poke fun at my gawky pronunciation now that I live just south of that beach. In a vacuum, learning Dutch should be a relative cakewalk for English-speakers. Dutch and English are both West Germanic languages, along with German. English has absorbed a bigger glut of Romance vocabulary over the last 900 years. But it's still hard to miss the deep  Germanic family ties when comparing English and Dutch. Even where spelling differs, hearing words like "huis" (house), "uit" (out) or "vergeten" (forget) spoken out loud reveals connections. While... Continue reading</description>

<title>Lexical facts</title>
<description>SEVERAL years ago we mentioned TestYourVocab.com here on the blog . Not long ago, the site reached its two millionth test result, and so the researchers have put together some data : Most adult native test-takers range from 20,000–35,000 words Average native test-takers of age 8 already know 10,000 words Average native test-takers of age 4 already know 5,000 words Adult native test-takers learn almost 1 new word a day until middle age Adult test-taker vocabulary growth basically stops at middle age The most common vocabulary size for foreign test-takers is 4,500 words Foreign test-takers tend to reach over 10,000 words by living abroad Foreign test-takers learn 2.5 new words a day while living in an English-speaking country In a separate post, though, comes a surprising fact : the reading of fiction specifically is as important as reading generally.  People who read "lots" and fiction "lots" outscore those who read "lots" but fiction only "somewhat" or "not much". This is because a wider range of vocabulary is typically used in fiction than in non-fiction writing.  And... Continue reading</description>

<title>Of nations, peoples, countries and mínzú</title>
<description>DID Joe Biden insult China?  The American vice-president has a habit of sticking his foot into his mouth, and in this case, the recent graduation speech he gave at the University of Pennsylvania inspired a viral rant by a "disappointed" Chinese student at Penn , Zhang Tianpu. What was Mr Biden's sin? Was it Mr Biden's suggestion that creative thought is stifled in China? You cannot think different in a nation where you cannot breathe free. You cannot think different in a nation where you aren't able to challenge orthodoxy, because change only comes from challenging orthodoxy. No, that wasn't it. The source of the insult is a surprising one: Mr Biden called China a "great nation", and a "nation" repeatedly after that. Victor Mair, the resident sinologist at the Language Log blog, translates Mr Zhang's complaint. In this sentence, "You CANNOT think different in a nation where you aren't able to challenge orthodoxy", he used the word "nation". This is what really infuriated me, because in English "nation" indicates "race, ethnicity", which is different from "country, state". "Country, state" perhaps places more...

<title>English atop the Eurovision pile, yet again</title>
<description>LAST Saturday saw Denmark win the Eurovision Song Contest , the country's third win in the contest's history. A prototypically apple-cheeked blonde (pictured) took the trophy for her country, but she did so with the rather un-Danish name of Emmelie de Forest and the equally un-Danish title , "Only Teardrops".  The contest has always been about more than music. Every year comes a slew of articles about the political nature of the voting . Countries that share ethnic or political friendships routinely give each other high marks: Greece and Cyprus typically give each other the maximum of 12 points while stiffing Turkey with  nul points,  for example. Estonia and Latvia this year gave Russia 12 points, no doubt because those countries' large Russian populations voted for their neighbour.  Language, of course, plays a role in this as well. "Ethnicity" in Europe is often linguistic: an ethnic... Continue reading</description>

<title>Setting the record straight</title>
<description>IT IS rare that Johnson is compelled to respond to comments. But my last post , about the fun parallels in the hybrid development of English and Dravidian languages, seems to have stirred the passions of our readers. Many of them commented, dismissing the post as (at best) misguided and (at worst) a piece of neocolonial rubbish. That is a shame. Studying the history of India’s languages can be immensely fascinating. With so much linguistic diversity in the subcontinent, Indian languages can provide a primer on nearly every major aspect of historical linguistics: the ways in which sound systems and grammars change over time, the impact of socioeconomic, ethnic and religious divides, the influence of foreign languages, and the development of writing systems, to name a few. India is home to 22 constitutionally recognised languages and hundreds more unrecognised ones. India is also home to sizable communities natively speaking major world languages like Farsi, Arabic, Chinese, Tibetan, English, Portuguese and French. India should be fascinating, to Johnson readers especially, because it is a microcosm of the world’s language diversity. The central focus of language studies in India is, of course, Sanskrit. As a liturgical language of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, Sanskrit has played an... Continue reading</description>

<title>The performing black folks next door</title>
<description>INTERNET memes rarely hit and then provoke counter-reaction this fast.  First, watch this video, whether or not you know the context. Now, the context. Three women had been missing in Cleveland for a decade. The man here, Charles Ramsey, rescued them after hearing a cry for help from a front door in his neighborhood. The area has been described as "rough" and working-class. From his speech you might guess that he is poor himself, and not highly educated. Now, did you find him funny?  Exotic?  Stupid?  If you found him funny, funny like an entertainer, or funny like entertainment?   I'll bet that how you see these things will correspond to some preconceived notions that you have.  And one writer, Aisha Harris for Slate,  found Mr Ramsey's rocket-ride to internet fame unsettling :  Ramsey has become the latest in a fairly recent trend of "hilarious" black neighbors, unwitting Internet celebrities whose appeal seems rooted in a "colorful" style that is always immediately recognizable as poor or working-class. Well, yes.... Continue reading</description>

<title>Eurasiatic?</title>
<description>THE Washington Post  reports today that linguists have discovered a handful of "ultraconserved" words, some 15,000 years old. These are said to include "hand", "give", "bark" and "ash". The paper is "Ultraconserved words point to deep language ancestry across Eurasia," by Mark Pagela, Quentin D. Atkinson, Andreea S. Calude, and Andrew Meade in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The  Post  buried the real news, though: what the new paper does is claim this as evidence that 7 modern language families, not yet conclusively shown to be related, are part of an Ur-family called proto-Eurasiatic. By their theory, the Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic, Inuit-Yupik, Dravidian, Chukchi-Kamchatkan and Kartvelian languages all share a common ancestor. The descendants of these proto-languages are spoken in a vast territory covering most of Eurasia including the Indian subcontinent today. What the  Post  doesn't even brush on is how controversial this is likely to be. Historical linguists have not just established the existence of proto-families. They have elaborately reconstructed them.  By... Continue reading</description>

<title>Unlikely parallels</title>
<description>IF FORCED to pick my favourite part of the history of English, I’d be torn. There are so many to choose from. Would I pick the Great Vowel Shift, the mid-millennium change in pronunciation that largely explains English’s inconsistent spelling? Perhaps I’d turn to colonial times, when English vocabulary ballooned. I do like Noah Webster’s attempts to change American English spelling in the name of efficiency, too. But my favourite must be the Norman invasion of 1066. When the Normans, who spoke a dialect of Old French, ruled over England, they changed the face of English. Over the ensuing two centuries, thousands of Old French words entered English. Because the ruling class spoke Old French, that set of vocabulary became synonymous with the elite. Everyone else used Old English. During this period, England's society was diglossic: one community, two language sets with distinct social spheres. Today, English-speakers pick and choose from the different word sets—Latinate (largely Old French borrowings) and Germanic (mostly Old English-derived words)—depending on the occasion. Although English is no longer in a diglossic relationship with another language, the Norman-era diglossia remains reflected in the way we choose and mix vocabulary. In informal chat, for example, we might go on to... Continue reading</description>

<title>Multilingual in the West</title>
<description>STATES that have passed English-only laws aren't typically the sort to shower money on bilingual education. Utah, which declared English its sole official language in 2000 , seems to be an exception. The  New York Times  recently reported that the state is expanding its langauge-immersion programs for young students. French, Spanish, Portuguese and Mandarin are currently on the docket. German and Arabic might follow. According to Utah's governor, this new initiative grows out of the Mormon mission tradition, during which missionaries are encouraged to learn local languages abroad. Utah is some 60% Mormon.  The teachers — most of them from other countries — teach regular subjects like mathematics and reading and social studies, only speaking exclusively in a foreign language. At first, they pantomime and use pictures and videos to get their point across, but they say the students can understand them within a few weeks. Utahns are quickly catching on. Parents, wary at first, have rushed to enter lotteries to place their children in the programs. Some school districts... Continue reading</description>

<description>BEN YAGODA at Lingua Franca  doesn't like the "historical present" : the tendency to use the present tense to describe past (and literary) events, as in this example from a radio interview about Lawrence Wright's book on Scientology : At some point L. Ron Hubbard takes to the sea and he moves the main people in Scientology to the sea with him. ... So at some point he decides to come back to land. He needs a safe place to be and a place where Scientology can flourish and he chooses Clearwater, Florida. Mr Yagoda concludes that describing the past this way is a crutch: "it's essentially a novelty item. It's tacky. Give it a rest." I don't quite agree, but his description of the historical present prompted this digression on another use of the present tense that he points out: jokes. (More specifically, jokes in the form of a funny story.)  Here's a well known example, which inspired the name of a book on punctuation that sold in the millions : A panda walks into a café. He orders... Continue reading</description>

<title>Who&#039;s number 1? Really?</title>
<description>WHAT country's non-native English-speakers speak the best business English in the world?  Try to think of five countries before reading on. Done?  The answer, according to GlobalEnglish, is probably not what you think.  (GlobalEnglish is owned by Pearson, which part-owns  The Economist ).  Remember that the survey tested non-native speakers, so don't be too distracted by the placement of the Anglophone countries.  Still, Global English's results are very strange. If you thought that the Philippines has the best business English in the world, and that Germany would miss the top 25, you haven't had the same work and travel experiences I have. Global English says this about its Business English Index: The GOE [Globalisation of English] and BEI [Business English Index] together give us a complete picture of the trends, achievements and challenges in business communication and the importance of Business English in the workplace. If this is a complete picture, we have a genuine stop-the-presses moment here: Madagascar, Bulgaria and Romania well ahead of Denmark, Switzerland and... Continue reading</description>

<title>An ombudsman by any other name would still field complaints</title>
<description>"MAN is born free, and everywhere he is in chains." So wrote Rousseau (" L'homme est né libre, et est partout dans les fers. ") Did he mean that just half the world's population, that half with a Y chromosome, was doomed to a life dans les fers ? No, he meant everyone. But as a man of his times, he wrote "man" ( l'homme ) and "he" ( il ). Even Karl Marx, a proto-feminist who wrote that "social progress can be measured by the social position of the female sex," otherwise used a German as male as Rousseau's French: And the [masculine] worker, who for twelve hours weaves, spins, drills, turns, builds, shovels, breaks stones, carries loads etc. - does he hold this twelve hours' weaving, spinning, drilling, turning, building, shoveling, stone breaking to be an expresion of his life, as life ?  [Und der Arbeiter, der zwölf Stunden webt, spinnt, bohrt, dreht, baut, schaufelt, Steine klopft, trägt usw. - gilt ihm dies zwölfstündige Weben, Spinnen, Bohren, Drehen, Bauen, Schaufeln, Steinklopfen als Äußerung seines Lebens, als Leben?] Note "weaving" and "spinning". Marx was not referring to the work that only men did in his time. But nonetheless, the German of the mid-19th century called for a "he" when referring to "the worker". Language, it seems, was in sexist chains for... Continue reading</description>

<description>Mastrionotti: Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it? Barton: Yeah. Mastrionotti: Yeah, I didn't think this dump was restricted. AT THE Lingua Franca blog, Ben Yagoda describes a conversation Ruth Fraklin of the  New Republic  over anti-Semitic code language  in America before and during the second world war. "Restricted" is perhaps the baldest of all the terms (as used by a thuggish detective in the Coen brothers' 1991 masterpiece,  Barton Fink , above). Apparently, "no Jews" code was particularly common in hotel advertisements. Mr Yagoda and Ms Franklin discuss "exclusive" and "selected clientele" among other euphemisms. Shockingly, ads like these persisted into the years of America's participation in the war against Hitler. At least a silver lining is that, on some level, people know naked racism is wrong, wrong enough to disguise in euphemism anyway. Anti-black racism needed no code in the pre-1960s era: "Whites Only", etc. Now, people know that it's not acceptable to reminisce about the good old days of Jim Crow. But several years ago I responded to a reader who, I thought, protested far too much in proclaiming that "ghetto" as an... Continue reading</description>
